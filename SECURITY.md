## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can use forums.minetest.net or the issues tab to inform me of mistakes and vulnerabilities.
I will try to fix the problem as soon as I can, but it may be a week or two.
If it is a real issue I will address it personally and it should be fixed by the time the next release is out; unless it is right before a release.
If not, I will notify you as a reply to your issue.
