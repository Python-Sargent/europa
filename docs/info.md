# First Off:
Documentaion is still very much in it's early stages.
This project is still in Alpha and it's not had a real release yet.
It is also only a few weeks (as of March 13 2023) old.

## To Live
 * Don't run out of food, you can get food from your lander or from wrecks of other landers.
 * Don't lose your lander, without your lander your chances of survival are low not to mention the lack of ability to advance.
 * Be careful with your oxygen, it may run out if your not careful.
 * Don't drink the water, it must be filtered by reverse-osmosis due the high levels of silica in the form of silicate (Si4O).
 * With the right planning you should be able to live well, the only problem is food, as oxygen (O), and water (H2O),
	are both present in large quantities, but must be extracted from the substrates that hold them.
 * Be careful with mining, as most caves contain water filled up all the way to the surface

## Mineral Extraction
In order to extract minerals from the nodes that they are in, you must put them through a refiner.
The steps go like this:
 1 - Drill ores and deposits to collect them
 2 - Place them into the refiner as you would a furnace from MTG (Minetest Game)
 3 - Place a battery into the bottom slot
And then you just wait, when it is done, you can use the refined materials to construct better tools and such.

## Spawning
When you spawn, you will spawn on top of the crust beside your lander, this lander is your home and your base, do not lose it.
The lander is also your primary source of electrical power, it charges all the time, but very slowly, only as fast as a normal solar array.
Depending an the settings you will start with different things, but as of this version you start with:
 * [Steel Drill], this drill can break all types of cracky-group (stone, ice, etc.) minerals.
 * [10 Space Rations], this is the most common food, use these sparingly as you may not find a crashed lander soon.
 * [Electric Lamp], this is your only light sourcee you start with, don't lose it.
 * [2 Batteries], these small charged batteries are used in most small machines and to build tool housings for drills and other tools.
 * [2 Tool Housings], these items are used for building tools, it is advised to be careful with them as they are hard to make.
 * [2 Refiners], these machines are used to extract and refine minerals from their substrates, this also can harden some crystals for use.
 * [Large Battery], this node is used in conjunction with a power supplier, it is charged to hold the current of the electrical components connected.

## Biomes
There are three biomes:
 * Polar, this biome simulates both the south and north poles.
 * equator, this biome simulates the eqautor, look for sharp points of ice called _pententites_.
 * cyrogeyser, this biome simulates the rifts and faults between the icesheets of the surface, ice permeates through the ocean under the crust.

## Minerals
There are several types of minerals:
### Crust Minerals
 * Silicate
 * Magnesium Sulfate
### Meteor Minerals
 * Platinum
 * Titanium
 * Chromium
Note: As this moon has been shown to be fairly young and protected, the meteors that have struck it have not permeated the crust.
If it were old the meteors would have been coverd with large amounts of ice.
### Core Minerals
 * Nickel Iron alloy
 * Nickel
 * Iron
### Refined Alloys
Besides the pure refined substrates, there are also several alloys as well, including:
 * Tempered Steel, this is not particularly a carbon steel in this sense as it does not take coal or other carbons to make.
 * Stainless Steel, this is slightly stronger than steel, and is very good with water.

## Note
As features are added I hope to continue to add documentation as the state of documentaion among other games is monstrous, I understand the need to not give things away, but that does not mean skipping documentation.
Therefore I will try my hardest to keep this documentation markdown up to date.
